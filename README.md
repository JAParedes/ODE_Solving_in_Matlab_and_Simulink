# Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) Solving with Matlab and Simulink
Tutorial files that present several methods to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with Matlab and Simulink. These files were used for Lecture 4 of the course AEROSP 470: Control of Aerospace Vehicles offered at the University of Michigan in the Winter 2021 semester. An associated video is available in this [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/VwlhxYTisk0).

## Files
* **lsim_Example.m** : Shows how to solve an ODE using _lsim_.
* **ode45_Example.m** : Shows how to solve an ODE using _ode45_.
* **plot_Simulink_Data_Example.m** : Runs and plots the results of **simulink_Comparison_Plot.slx**.
* **simulink_Example.slx** : Shows how to solve an ODE using different methods in Simulink.
* **simulink_Comparison_Plot.slx** : Same as **simulink_Example.slx**, shows how to send Simulink results to Matlab for plotting. Used by **plot_Simulink_Data_Example.m**.
* **SS_vs_TF_Simulink.slx** : Shows how to solve an ODE using Transfer Function and State Space blocks in Simulink.
